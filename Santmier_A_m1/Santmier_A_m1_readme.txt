Main Scene: demo

Everything requested from m1 should be present in the build. On the Root Motion Control Script on the SomeDude_RootMotion
gameobject, the animation speed has been set to 1.2, root movement speed to 1.2, and root turn speed to 1.1. This is a
faster speed as asked in the assignment, and looks good, at least to my eyes. The minion's forward animations move
the same way the non root motion one does and emits sounds at the same time as well.
